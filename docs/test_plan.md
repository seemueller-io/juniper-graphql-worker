# Juniper GraphQL Worker Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan outlines the critical tests needed to ensure the proper functioning and reliability of the Juniper GraphQL Worker application. The focus is on tests that support the core architecture of the program, ensuring that all components work together correctly and that the application meets its performance and reliability goals.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

#### GraphQL Schema Tests
- **Test Query Resolvers**
  - Test the `api_version` resolver returns the correct version
  - Test the `human` resolver correctly fetches human data
  - Test error handling when human ID is not found

#### Model Tests
- **Test Human Model**
  - Verify that Human objects can be created with all required fields
  - Verify that Episode enum values are correctly defined and used

#### Database Tests
- **Test Database Connection**
  - Verify that database connections can be established
  - Test error handling for connection failures
- **Test Data Operations**
  - Test `find_human` functionality
  - Test `insert_human` functionality
  - Test error handling for database operations

#### Context Tests
- **Test Context Creation**
  - Verify that Context objects can be created with required dependencies
  - Test that Context correctly implements the juniper::Context trait

### 2. Integration Tests

#### GraphQL API Tests
- **Test GraphQL Endpoint**
  - Verify that the GraphQL endpoint responds to valid queries
  - Test error responses for invalid queries
  - Verify that the endpoint handles both GET and POST requests
- **Test GraphQL Playground**
  - Verify that the GraphQL Playground is accessible
  - Test that the Playground can execute queries against the API

#### End-to-End Tests
- **Test Complete Workflows**
  - Test querying for a human and receiving correct data
  - Test creating a new human and then querying for it
  - Test error scenarios and verify appropriate error responses

### 3. Performance Tests

#### Load Testing
- **Test API Performance Under Load**
  - Verify response times under normal load
  - Test behavior under high concurrency
  - Identify performance bottlenecks

#### Cold Start Testing
- **Test Worker Cold Start Performance**
  - Measure cold start times
  - Verify functionality after cold starts
  - Test strategies to minimize cold start impact

### 4. Security Tests

#### Authentication Tests
- **Test Authentication Mechanisms** (once implemented)
  - Verify that protected endpoints require authentication
  - Test token validation
  - Test expired token handling

#### Authorization Tests
- **Test Access Control** (once implemented)
  - Verify that users can only access authorized resources
  - Test role-based access control
  - Test error responses for unauthorized access attempts

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Priority Order
1. Unit tests for core components (schema, models, database)
2. Integration tests for the GraphQL API
3. End-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. Performance tests
5. Security tests (as authentication and authorization are implemented)

### Test Environment
- Development: Local environment using wrangler dev
- Staging: Cloudflare Workers preview environment
- Production: Cloudflare Workers production environment

### Continuous Integration
- Implement automated testing in CI pipeline
- Run unit and integration tests on every pull request
- Run performance tests on significant changes
- Generate test coverage reports

## Test Maintenance

- Review and update tests as new features are added
- Refactor tests as the codebase evolves
- Maintain test documentation
- Regularly review test coverage and identify gaps

## Conclusion

This test plan focuses on the critical tests needed to support the architecture of the Juniper GraphQL Worker application. By implementing these tests, we can ensure that the application functions correctly, performs well, and remains reliable as it evolves.
